    "### Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "A decision tree classifier splits data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like model of decisions. It predicts by traversing the tree from root to leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Provide a step-by-step explanation of the mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification.\n",
    "1. **Calculate Impurity**: Use Gini Index or Entropy.\n",
    "2. **Choose Best Split**: Select feature and threshold minimizing impurity.\n",
    "3. **Split Data**: Divide data at chosen split.\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Recursively split subsets until stopping criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Explain how a decision tree classifier can be used to solve a binary classification problem.\n",
    "A decision tree splits data based on feature values to separate classes. For binary classification, it creates branches until subsets are pure or meet stopping criteria, predicting the class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Discuss the geometric intuition behind decision tree classification and how it can be used to make predictions.\n",
    "Decision trees partition the feature space into rectangular regions. Each region corresponds to a leaf node, predicting the majority class of data points within that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Define the confusion matrix and describe how it can be used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.\n",
    "A confusion matrix shows true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It helps evaluate a modelâ€™s accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Provide an example of a confusion matrix and explain how precision, recall, and F1 score can be calculated from it.\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "|            | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |\n",
    "|------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| Actual Positive | 50                  | 10                  |\n",
    "| Actual Negative | 5                   | 35                  |\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision**: \\( \\frac{TP}{TP+FP} = \\frac{50}{50+5} = 0.91 \\)\n",
    "- **Recall**: \\( \\frac{TP}{TP+FN} = \\frac{50}{50+10} = 0.83 \\)\n",
    "- **F1 Score**: \\( 2 \\times \\frac{Precision \\times Recall}{Precision + Recall} = 0.87 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Discuss the importance of choosing an appropriate evaluation metric for a classification problem and explain how this can be done.\n",
    "Choosing the right metric ensures model performance aligns with business goals. Evaluate the cost of false positives/negatives and select metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. Provide an example of a classification problem where precision is the most important metric, and explain why.\n",
    "In email spam detection, precision is crucial to minimize misclassifying legitimate emails as spam, avoiding loss of important communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9. Provide an example of a classification problem where recall is the most important metric, and explain why.\n",
    "In disease screening, recall is critical to identify as many positive cases as possible, ensuring patients receive necessary treatment despite some false positives."
